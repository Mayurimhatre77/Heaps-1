#I initialized an empty list k to store all the node values from the input linked lists. I then iterated over each linked list in lists, and for each node in these lists, I appended the node's value to the list k. After collecting all the values, I sorted the list k. Using a dummy head node for the resulting merged list, I iterated over the sorted values in k, creating new nodes and linking them sequentially to form the merged linked list. Finally, I returned the node following the dummy head, which is the head of the merged linked list. The time complexity of this approach is O(NlogN), where N is the total number of nodes across all linked lists (due to the sorting step). The space complexity is O(N), as we store all the node values in the list k and create a new linked list to return the result.
